# Age-Invariant Face Recognition using GANs and Vision Transformers

This project presents a **unified deep learning framework** for **Age-Invariant Face Recognition (AIFR)** by combining **CycleGAN-based synthetic aging**, **contrastive and triplet loss learning**, and multiple feature extractors including **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**, and **Vision Transformers (ViT)**.

We address challenges like **large age gaps**, **dataset diversity**, and **robust identity preservation** across facial aging processes.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

- **GAN-Based Augmentation**: Use CycleGAN to create synthetic age-progressed images for training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Models like ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0, VGG19, ViT-B/16 extract robust facial embeddings.
- **Learning Strategies**:
  - **Contrastive Learning** (Siamese networks) on UTKFace.
  - **Triplet Loss Training** on MORPH dataset.
  - **Binary MLP Classification** on paired embeddings.
- **Evaluation**: Performance measured on UTKFace, MORPH, and FG-NET datasets using accuracy, contrastive loss, triplet loss, and embedding distance analysis.
